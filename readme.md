# Python Learning Project

This project is my personal journey of learning Python step-by-step.

## What I've Learned So Far
- Variables and data types
- Taking input from users
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- More coming soon...

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open in PyCharm
3. Run the `.py` files individually
